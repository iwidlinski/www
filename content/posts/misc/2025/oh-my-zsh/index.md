Today I learned about [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/).

I've got it installed and running on my laptop. The reason to get it is because *Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one*. Which hit the spot.

Oh My Zsh makes Zsh sleek and I ended up changing my default SHELL to ZSH, but I do not plan to switch exclusively to ZSH as BASH is still the SHELL to be used on servers, and everywhere else.
