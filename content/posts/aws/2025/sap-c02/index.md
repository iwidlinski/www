Last Friday I passed [SAP-C02](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) the **AWS Solution Architect - Professional** exam. 

This is my second AWS certificate having passed the **AWS Solution Architect - Associate** couple of months earlier.

SAP-C02 took me about 2 months to study for and I used the following resources to study:
- [Cantrill's AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional). This course was almost 70 hours long, and it took me about 1 montht to go through. It is a good course, but gosh is it long... I feel like it would be much better to complete 3 courses that are ~20 hours long instead of doing single Cantrill's class.
- [Stephene Maarek's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional 2025 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-solutions-architect-professional/). I ended up doing this course twice, with the second time being 3 days before the exam ( this involved 5+ hours per day cram sessions). Highly recommend
- My own AWS Organization created just for learning and practice. This org is made out of 3 accounts, with SSO set up ( using Azure).
- [Tutorial's Dojo Tests](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-practice-exams/). These test are not perfect, and sometimes frustrating ( due to gramma, and the way they are written). For ~$15 USD the value is unbeatable. My test scores were as follows:
  - Review mode Set 1: 73%
  - Review mode Set 2: 76%
  - Review mode Set 3: 76%
- [Stephane Maarek's Udemy SAP-C02 Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exam-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/learn/). My scores were:
  - Practice mode Test 1: 72%
  - Practice mode Test 2: 52% ( not sure what happened here, but I was sick and feverish when I did this one)
- [Neal Davis' Udemy SAP-C02 Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-aws-practice-exams/learn/quiz/5156504#content). My scores were:
  - Test #1: 74%
  - Test #2: 71%
  - Test #3: 82%

Overall the test took me 2 hours and 40 minutes to write, and overall was tough, but I felt confident I passed it when it was all done.
